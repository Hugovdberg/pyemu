 NUMLAM is supplied as negative. This will be reset to positive. If Parallel 
   PEST or BEOPEST is used PARLAM will automatically be set to -9999.
 NOPTMAX provided as zero. No optimisation iterations will be carried out; 
   objective function and residuals will be recorded for initial parameter 
   estimates only.
 MAXSING in the singular value decomposition section is greater than the
